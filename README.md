In this application, I designed my portfolio as a webpage with AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap architecture.
This project demonstrates Angular Routing to display various views(Pages) from a single Page without server request.
I have used d3charts, to demonstrate the percentile of skillset.
Also, Embedded Google maps is available in contact page.

*Sample Screenshots.*
