In this application, I designed my portfolio as a webpage with AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap architecture.
This project demonstrates **Angular Promises** and **Routing** to display various views(Pages) from a single Page **(SPA)**.
I have used d3charts, to demonstrate the percentile of skillset.
Also, Embedded Google maps is available in contact page.

Used NodeJS and ExpressJS for server setup, middleware implementation and Restful Services.

To run the app,
* Download the source files, except the package.json file.

* Install "body-parser", "express", method-override, fs, path via npm command promt with -save command to create dependencies in the package.json file.
* In Command Prompt, navigate to the source folder and run command "node server.js"
