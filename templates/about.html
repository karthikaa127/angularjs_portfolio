                    <p> I am a front-end developer, graduate of Computer Applications. 
                    I have experience providing responsive front-end development for various clients. 
                    I develop clean and elegant web pages with semantic, pixel perfect and responsive layout. 
                    My day-to-day work involves cutting and slicing PSDs and converting them to hand-coded Semantic HTML5, CSS3 and 
                    adding Javascript/jQuery magic with cross-browser compatibility. 
                    I design responsive websites for mobiles, tablets and PCs using CSS media queries. 
                    I also worked on AngularJS, ExtJS applications with Bootstrap and LESS for styles. </p>
                    <p> I am experienced with Agile approach and used Github for version control in my previous projects. 
                    I have worked majorly on Commonspot and Drupal in CMS. 
                    I am proficient with Photoshop, Eclipse, Dreamweaver and Sublime. 
                    Having wide range of knowledge and experience, 
                    I am very much capable of working independently as well as part of a team.</p>
